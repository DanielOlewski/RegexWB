Unit tests:

*) Add option to hide match and other items in the output textbox.

*) Change the save code so that it just uses the save dialog, not the intermediate dialog

1) The alternate beginning and end of line anchors aren't interpreted correctly.

2) Add in support to interpret conditional expressions:

	(?(expression)yes|no)
	
	This will likely require a whole new class to do properly. It will need to:
	
		a) Match the "?(" part. 
		b) Parse an expression
		c) check for the closing brace.
		d) parse the yes|no expression 
		e) decode the RegexExpression for yes no, and break at the first alternation that
		   we find. 
		   
 3) Make split work on multi-line strings, rather than splitting on each line.

4) Add a context menu for "add" on the regex window, so you can right-click
