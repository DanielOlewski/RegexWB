Subject: Regular Expression Workbench bug

Hi Eric,

I want to start by saying thanks for a great tool!

I've found that the following Regular Expression doesn't seem be handled correctly in the Regular Expression Edit Box:

  [\[\]]

My understanding of RE is that it should evaluate to 'Any character in "[]"'.  Currently, the pop displays 'Any character in "\[\" which is incorrect.

If it helps any, I obtained the source from the GotDotNet site in the user samples area.  Its listed as version 1.04 on the site.

Again, thanks for a great tool!
